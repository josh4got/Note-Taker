# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is a web application that creates,stores,and deletes notes. This project was made to provide an easy-to-use web based tool for note taking. This project eliminates having to use a seperate software to take and store notes.

This project taught me how to use Node.js and Express to build a website back-end, set proper routes, and use Heroku to deploy a web application.
